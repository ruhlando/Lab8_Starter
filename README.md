#### How are graceful degradation and service workers related?
Graceful degradation means building a full-featured experience using modern technologies, but making sure the core functionality of your website still works even if some features (like JavaScript or new browser APIs) aren’t available. Service workers help support graceful degradation by improving performance and offline support — but they are not required for the site to function. If the browser doesn’t support service workers, the website will still load normally, just without features like caching or offline access. So service workers enhance the experience when supported, while graceful degradation ensures the site remains usable without them.
